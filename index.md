# Spin Dynamics and Quantum Chemistry by Luca Gerhards
### *Comprehending emergence of biological effects induced trhough the microscopic quantum world*

Hello, I’m Luca Gerhards, a theoretical chemist deeply engaged in unraveling the molecular and quantum mechanisms that underlie complex biological effects, including those essential to life itself. My research dives into the interactions between magnetic fields and molecular structures within biological systems, which range from fundamental spin dynamics to their concrete influence on cellular functions and large-scale biological processes.

At the core of my work lies the quest to decode how subtle quantum phenomena—like spin-selective reactions, weak magnetic field effects, and radical pair mechanisms—manifest in the macroscopic, wet, and noisy environments typical of living organisms. By using advanced modeling approaches, including multiscale simulations, quantum chemistry, and spin dynamics, I seek to bridge our understanding from the subatomic scale to the emergence of highly organized, responsive biological systems.
