### [MolSpin](https://github.com/Das0Mann/MolSpin)
MolSpin, short for Molecular Spin Dynamics, is a general software designed to perform any kind of calculation on spin systems. The MolSpin software package is a virtual spin dynamics laboratory that allows exploration of any spin system or any process involving spins.

It is designed to be as general as possible, and with a great emphasis on extensibility making it easy to implement new algorithms when the standard features does not suffice - and extending MolSpin is much easier than writing a new script in e.g. Matlab. Also note that in contrast to other spin dynamics software packages, MolSpin is not limited to specific calculation types, such as solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation, but can also support completely different tasks such as semi-classical simulations or simulate a quantum computer.

### [SiMBols](https://gitlab.uni-oldenburg.de/quantbiolab/simbols)
SiMBols is a python package designed to make similarity measures easily accessible for biological systems and to compare spatio-temporal data. The package offers a unified approach to calculate the Frechet distance, the weak Frechet distance, the Hausdorff distance, dynamic time warping, Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, longest common subsequence and an approach based on difference distance matrices. SiMBols is developed and maintained by **Fabian Schuhmann**. [URL](https://gitlab.uni-oldenburg.de/quantbiolab/simbols)
